        <p class="tutorial-text">
          The basic concept behind white box testing is that testers have prior
          knowledge of how the software works. Its main goal is to know how the
          software should work. Then, perform testing to verify that it works
          properly.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          The white box testing technique is used in development to examine the
          program structure and business logic. Testers perform validation of
          the entire code structure of an application. It is also called clear
          box testing, glass box testing, open box testing, transparent box
          testing, and structural testing.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">White Box Testing Techniques include:</p>

        <ul class="tutorial-text">
          <li>
            Statement Coverage – It examines all the programming statements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Branch Coverage – Performs a series of test runs to ensure detailed
            testing of all the branches.
          </li>

          <li>
            Path Coverage – Perform testing on all the possible paths to cover
            each statement and branch.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          The next question would be, why do we perform White Box Testing? The
          answers are simple.
        </p>

        <ul class="tutorial-text">
          <li>
            To check correct execution of all the independent paths within a
            module.
          </li>
          <li>
            To verify all logical decisions on their true and false values.
          </li>
          <li>
            To determine that all loops are within their boundaries and the
            operational bounds of internal data structures are valid.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Also, to discover the following types of errors:
        </p>

        <ul class="tutorial-text">
          <li>
            Logical error concerning functions, conditions, or controls related
            to design and implementation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The design errors due to the difference between the logical flow of
            the program and the actual environment.
          </li>
          <li>Typographical and error syntax.</li>
