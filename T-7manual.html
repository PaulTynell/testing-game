          In manual software testing, human judgment and intuition always
          benefit the project. Testers use manual testing with the scripted or
          exploratory method. The benefit of manual testing is getting fast and
          accurate feedback. Also, it is less expensive as it doesnâ€™t involve
          automation tools and processes.

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Human judgment may be an advantage as it can also make this method
          less reliable. For example, when there is a limited number of testers
          for a large-scale project, it can cause bottlenecks. These bottlenecks
          will wear out testers and often result in several undetected bugs.
