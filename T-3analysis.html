        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Dynamic analysis involves actual program execution to expose possible
          errors and failed functionalities. Also, part of dynamic analysis is
          behavioral and performance properties of the software.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          The software tester’s goal is to identify as many faults as possible.
          Static analysis is best for identifying errors at the early stage of
          software development. On the other hand, dynamic analysis performs
          well in parallel with development. Hence, these two are complementary
          and offer better effectiveness if used together
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Additionally, testing methods may also fall in another type of
          categories:
        </p>

        <ol class="tutorial-text">
          <li>Verification</li>
          <p>
            This method determines whether the product of a given development
            phase satisfies the requirements. These requirements are either
            established at the start of the development or the beginning of a
            certain phase. Testers verify the features stated in the requirement
            specification, design specification, code, etc. are correct.
          </p>
          <li>Validation</li>
          <p>
            Validation confirms that a product serves its purpose. It involves
            activities that check whether a product achieves its customer’s
            expectations. Also, it focuses on the final product, which undergoes
            extensive testing from the customer’s point of view. To sum it up,
            validation establishes whether the product meets the overall
            expectations of the users.
