        <p class="tutorial-text">
          In scripted testing, a tester follows an outline, which is also known
          as script. This script is essential in the testing method as it
          includes test cases and its corresponding test steps. Indeed, these
          steps are scripted and are suitable for fulfilling a specified
          requirement. Scripted box testing works well with functional and
          non-functional testing.

        <h1>Exploratory</h1>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          The opposite of scripted is exploratory testing. This is where testers
          have full autonomy to work around the software application based on
          their instinct. This method is perfect for finding hidden risks or
          errors.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Remember that no matter how stringent scripted testing is, there are
          still possibilities for some glitches to occur. For example, an
          incorrect tooltip content might confuse end-users or a redundant
          button that may confuse the users.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Truly, exploratory testing understands how actual users navigate the
          application. On the other hand, scripted testing ensures that the
          software is ready for deployment. Hence, software testers and product
          owners always use these two methods in parallel.
