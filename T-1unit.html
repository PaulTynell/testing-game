        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Before delving into the different testing methods, let’s define
          software testing first.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Software testing is a process to determine the quality of a software
          product or service. These are performed by software testers to find
          errors and bugs. Testers formulate a batch of use cases and conduct
          test runs.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          After every batch of a test run, features with defects are sent to the
          developers to fix. Then, developers send the fixed features back to
          the testing team for re-evaluation. After this, the software tester
          runs the test cases to confirm that there are no errors. The cycle
          continues until the software product attains a desired level of
          quality.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          In software development, there are a variety of testing methods.
          Choosing the right tools to use can prove to be cumbersome. Thus, it
          is the job of the Quality Assurance team to establish a suitable
          testing method to use and assess the methods if it fits with the
          product type and the development team’s attributes.
        </p>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          Testing is vital as it measures all aspects of the software’s
          functionality. Remember, a crucial defect left undetected can cause
          vast amounts of losses to a business.

        <h1>8 Software Testing Methods</h1>

        <p class="tutorial-text">
          To understand the concept of these methods, let’s have an overview of
          software testing. Software testing belongs to two broad categories:
          static and dynamic analysis. Let’s explore further.
